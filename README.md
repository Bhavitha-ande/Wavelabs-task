# Wavelabs-task
Wavelabsâ€™ Lab setup consists of a network of n nodes, labeled from 1 to n. As a Network Engineer, you are given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (u_i, v_i, w_i), where u_i is the source node, v_i is the target node, and w_i is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.
